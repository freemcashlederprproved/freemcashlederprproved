A corner bakery is seeking $10,000 to purchase ingredients for bread, pastries, and cookies, as well as paper packaging and boxes. With only an oven and a few furniture fixtures, the small business does not have enough assets to obtain an asset-based loan from the bank down the street. It turns to an online lender for a cash flow loan to finance the raw material inventory. As the bakery turns its products into cash over the next several weeks, it repays the $10,000 loan with interest.
