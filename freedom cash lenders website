 Cash flow loans are typically sought by small companies that do not have a long credit history, significant assets to back a loan, or an established track record of profitability. Because of these factors, a lender will command higher interest rates on a cash flow loan to compensate it for greater repayment risk, although in some cases a blanket lien or personal guarantees by the signer(s) of the loan will be required as part of the debt agreement.

In addition, the origination fee of a cash flow loan is higher than that of a traditional loan and is further subject to greater fees on late payments. However necessary it may be to take out a cash flow loan, in the case of a small business that lacks financing options, it should be repaid as quickly as possible, as it represents a drain on the finances of the business.
